My personal website

## Warning
This was written by my former self back in 2010.  Back then I did everything in production and didn't use source control.  Some day I may rewrite the site in a way that's actually mantainable.  But today is not that day. For now, I just wanna make sure the source code is somewhere I'll be able to find in the future...
